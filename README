Test/MockDBI version 0.66
=========================

Test::MockDBI lets you test DBI interfaces by mocking-up the
DBI interface with Test::MockObject in any way you choose.
Standard output of the resulting program can then be
examined as to whether your program correctly uses the DBI.
Mock DBI interfaces like Test::MockDBI improve upon DBI
tracing facilities like DBI::trace() and DBD::Mock, as you
can modify the behavior of the DBI at the interface in
(nearly) any way you choose.

Once you "use Test::MockDBI", invoking Test::MockDBI
instead of the regular DBI is a matter of supplying a first
command-line argument of the form "--dbitest[=TYPE]" to
your program (or using Test::MockDBI::set_dbi_test_type()).
TYPE is the MockDBI testing type, which is a simple integer
number (/^\d+$/).  The testing type is set to 1 (one)
if TYPE is missing.  A testing type of 0 (zero) turns off
Test::MockDBI, leaving your program to use DBI as normal.
This makes using Test::MockDBI transparent to users --
they never know that Test::MockDBI was used unless you
tell them about it.

There are 3 basic ways to change DBI behavior with
Test::MockDBI:

    bad_method
        Force a DBI method to fail when the current SQL
        matches the supplied pattern.

    bad_param
        Force a DBI method to fail when the current input
        parameters match the supplied pattern.

    set_retval_array
    set_retval_scalar
        Force specific return values when the current SQL
        matches the supplied pattern.

For more flexibility, the match can also be made against the
current testing type ("-dbitest[=TYPE]"), i.e. both the
testing type and the current SQL must match.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Makefile.PL will ask you for DBI configuration parameters,
placing them into ./DBI.cfg.  This DBI.cfg is not removed
even by "make distclean", which should make repeated testing
a little easier.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  DBI
  Test::MockObject

Test::MockDBI has been tested with Test::MockObject
v0.14 on Linux and Test::MockObject v0.20 on cygwin under
Windows XP.  DBI was v1.43.

WHY CHOOSE Test::MockDBI OVER DBI::trace() OR DBD::Mock?

Test::MockDBI has a major advantage over DBI::trace()
or DBD::Mock -- Test::MockDBI lets you change how the
mocked DBI functions behave, along with modifying
what data is returned by the mocked DBI functions.
These changes and modifications can be made specific
to particular SQL statement patterns, as well as being
specific to a particular invocation of the program by
using the "--dbitest[=TYPE]" first command-line argument
or Test::MockDBI::set_dbi_test_type().

This ability to modify DBI function behavior and
DBI-returned data makes it easier to test code that has
different branches for different DBI behaviors -- you
can test that a failure within DBI or returned DB data
that is different than normal is processed correctly by
your module or program.  If you are taking over a large
code base, Test::MockDBI will help in understanding the
code by allowing you to safely check how the code behaves
under different database conditions without modifying any
databases (production or otherwise).
