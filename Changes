Revision history for Perl extension Test::MockDBI.
0.70 Tue Aug 14
    - Almost completely rewritten the code
    - Added support for more mocked methods
    - Test::MockDBI now returns the correct object types (DBI::db &
      DBI::st)
    - DBI::db methods is not available throught DBI::st object and
      vica versa
    - Deleted old tests, and written new ones.
    - Added mockup for all dbi object attributes (Not all of them
      actually have a value yet)
    - Handle "Stringification of regexes has changed" (see
      perl5140delta).  Both older and new version of perl should work.

0.66  Tue July  24 11:25:08 CET 2012

    - Added the support for attributes RaiseError,
      PrintError and AutoCommit with implementation
    - Added DBI::db::bind_param_inout() and DBI::db::begin_work()
    - DBI::db::commit() now works, rather than only
      pretending to work.
    - Added DBI::db::rollback()
    - Supports call to the method err

0.65  Mon Feb  7 07:46:08 CET 2011

    - Removed duplicate 'use Data::Dumper' (See cpanratings).

0.64  Tue Feb  3 13:37:20 CET 2009
    - Support non-interactive testing with
        PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT, and/or
        AUTOMATED_TESTING

0.63  Wed Dec 31 14:29:14 CET 2008
    - Added support for DBI::ping (bug #14055)

0.62  Thu Dec  4 14:05:50 CET 2008
    - Added support for hash-based fetch methods.
    - Added customization of DBI->errstr(), now undef
      by default.
    - Rewritten test suite Test::Harness style.
    - Added underscore prefix to private subs to fit
      with Pod::Coverage.

0.61  Thu Feb  3 09:28:49 EST 2005
    - Fixed version number in README.
    - Fixed copyright dates in README.
    - Moved test DBD setup to samples/DBD-setup.pl
      from samples/sample.pl.

0.60  Thu Jan 27 17:18:47 EST 2005
    - Added DBI::do() and DBI::rows().
    - DBI::bind_columns() now works, rather than only
      pretending to work.
    - DBI::fetchrow() was corrected to return an array.
      This function is so old, it is no longer documented
      in the main DBI docs.
    - The list-returning DBI fetch*() functions now
      return an empty list when set_retval_array() gives
      them an empty list or no list.
    - A list consisting of 1 undef element is now
      returned as such by the list-returning DBI
      fetch*() methods.
    - README now talks a little about the testing
      configuration file, DBI.cfg.
    - NOTE: The Perl Cookbook, 2nd Edition, recipe 10.10
      has a good explanation of list/array return values :).

0.50  Wed Dec  1 08:34:30 EST 2004
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
      --compat-version=5.8.0 -AXfn Test::MockDBI
    - Separate test program sources are now in
      "t-src/*.PL", with a PL_FILES directive in
      Makefile.PL to create the actual test programs as
      "t/*.pl".
